# Important Notice
Please be aware that I'm struggling to maintain this plugin.  Even after considerable effort, I have been unable to produce a reliable development environment.

While I will work to rectify this, neither Android or Cordova/ Phonegap development represent a priority to me.  Neither present me with paid income or particularly excite me enough to put aside other projects.

I will make attempts to be more active in responding to questions â€“ and apologies for any previous delays.

Please keep the above in mind before actively using this plugin.

# Scheduler Plugin

## Quick summary
Plugin which allows you to schedule an alarm which will start your app.
 
## Getting started
The plugin can be installed using the following commands (this assumes you are familiar with the [Cordova Android Getting Started] (http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.3.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide)):

* cordova create hello com.example.hello "HelloWorld"
* cd hello
* cordova platform add android
* cordova plugin add https://github.com/Red-Folder/Scheduler-Plugin.git
* Amend the hello\www\config.xml, replace any existing content node with: `<content src="scheduler.html" />` (add the content node if not already present)
* cordova build
* Add the following to platforms\android\src\com\example\hello\HelloWorld.java in the onCreate() method:
```
// You will also need to add - import com.red_folder.phonegap.plugin.scheduler.ActivityHelper; at the top of the java file
ActivityHelper.onCreate(this);
```
* You should then be able to open, build the Android project (platforms\android) within Eclipse

You should be able to run the example.

## Development
This is a very early version of the plugin and is under active development.

Please see the [Enhancements List] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/Scheduler-Plugin/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open) for the planned changes. 

Please read the [Release Notes] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/Scheduler-Plugin/wiki/Release-Notes) between version as function signature is very likely to change while in active development.

## Questions and Support
If you have problems, then please log an issue: https://github.com/Red-Folder/Scheduler-Plugin/issues?state=open

As the plugin is updated (for new features or fixes) I will tweet via @FolderRed and blog http://red-folder.blogspot.co.uk/

## Spread the love

If you find the Plugin useful then spread the love.

All the work I do on the Plugin is done in my spare time - time I would otherwise be spending taking my wife out for a nice meal or helping my lad find vinyl records (he's currently very much into The Smiths, Fleetwood Mac and Kate Bush).

The Plugin is free and will always remain free. I will continue to develop, maintain and distribute the Plugin under the Apache 2.0 License.
